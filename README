garbagefinder - Recursively searches current directory for files containing
only the null character (0x00) and reports those files' names to stdout.


I created this quick hack after I had a hard drive crash. At first glance, I
was able to recover all files. But many of them turned out to be full of 0x00
and nothing else. So I wrote this tool to recover all the lost space on my new
disk, because storing gigabytes worth of zeroes is somewhat pointless.

Just make it and then run it from any directory. It will search the files in
the current directory and all subdirectories recursively, and print out one
line per garbage file found, relative to the current directory.
